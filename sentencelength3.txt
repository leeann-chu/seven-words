 Do you know what that meant, boy
 I din't know the Chandrian were demons,
 Are you telling this story, Jacob Walker
 Are they men who sold their souls
 It's about time you got in, Carter
 She was gentle as a lamb, too
 What are you going to do now
 How did it get all these cracks
 Sometimes spiders twitch after you kill them
 There's one way to tell for sure,
 You haven't been this late in weeks,
 So, what did you learn today, Bast
 Being, of course, an exceptionally clever student
 Carter was attacked by a scraeling tonight
 There's no such thing as one scraeling,
 The fact remains there was only one
 Bast, it was one of the scrael
 I used up nearly all my gut
 What did you do with the body
 Maybe they died coming over the mountains,
 I like your first idea better, Reshi,
 They didn't get to the news tonight
 I tend to make my own fun
 By earth and stone, I abjure you
 She's not much of a horse, sir,
 Except for about twenty pounds of oats
 Here's a pair for your pair, then
 It'll go badly if he drinks it
 I tend to think too much, Bast
 So you're trying to avoid second-guessing yourself
 Don't bother being disturbed on my account
 When his eyes are black as crow
 Move like ghosts from place to place
 They say no one can mend them
 Are you saying I look like Kvothe
 It gives out every now and then
 Could you do me a favor, son
 One of them knows who I am
 Give him something to make him sleep
 I was a city-licensed escort from Ralien
 Keep an eye on things, will you
 Just plain old pig-iron would do nicely
 A jot would be a great plenty
 We haven't had rain in a while
 I don't know who you're waiting for,
 Listen, I'm guessing you're an educated man
 But here and now, tonight, you're wrong
 I don't suppose you have any weapons
 A sword wouldn't do you much good
 One of them was all over you
 I didn't have a lot of options
 Let me tell you what to do
 Dig a pit that's ten by two
 My supplies are down in the basement
 How many did the other fellow kill
 I'm a fair hand at avoiding it
 How odd to watch a mortal kindle
 And the wind will have its way
 Would I could my own fire lend
 I know you're going to deny it,
 I wasn't trying to be difficult before
 The Mating Habits of the Common Draccus
 Honestly, I was a little disappointed myself
 Taken you under his wing, has he
 So what can I do for you
 Come now, surely you must want something
 I didn't expect to actually find you
 —and I am not what I was,
 Old enemies don't try to settle scores
 People don't come asking you for stories,
 You know which will win, given time
 Some people say there was a woman—
 What do they know about what happened
 Nothing but the truth could break me
 An appointment with the Earl of Baedn-Bryt,
 My horse was stolen near Abbott's Ford
 But I'm willing to lose some sleep
 And you'll get none of it tonight
 A real story takes time to prepare
 I could spend tomorrow collecting your story…
 Five hundred, if you count the lies
 I've been thinking about this all backward,
 Most simply tell me what they remember
 They prefer their stories be left alone
 But they also prefer an attentive audience
 I'll bet you don't spoil many pages
 I heard about it at the University
 We were telling stories before Caluptena burned
 Before there were books to write in
 Her voice twinning, mixing with my own
 The smell of blood and burning hair
